# f7-supersonic-ember

This is an experimental project combining : 

* Ember.js Javascript application framework http://emberjs.com/
* Framework7 http://www.idangero.us/framework7/ - a HTML framework for mobile apps
* Appgyver Supersonic www.appgyver.com/supersonic - a framework and extension of the Cordova mobile runtime

In git terms I cloned buzzware/supersonic-ember and hand merged in the "dummy" application code from ember-mobile/ember-cli-framework7.
 
This is an attempt to put together a stack for developing mobile apps in Ember. Framework7 provides pretty much everything for developing 
iOS apps in HTML without being tied to any framework, which makes it a rare candidate for integration with Ember.
